      "Nvidia and Foxconn have announced a joint plan to build a large-scale AI supercomputer in Taiwan, which will be operated by Foxconn's subsidiary, Big Innovation Company. Revealed during the Computex 2025 trade show, the project is backed by Taiwan's National Science and Technology Council and is being described as a national AI infrastructure initiative.\n",
      "\n",
      "The supercomputer will feature 10,000 of Nvidia's latest Blackwell GPUs and will incorporate the company's Blackwell Ultra systems, including the GB300 NVL72 rack-scale platform. It is expected to become one of the most powerful AI computing systems in Asia, offering access to startups, researchers, and enterprises across various sectors. The infrastructure will be integrated with Nvidia DGX Cloud Lepton, enabling flexible GPU use for a wide range of users.\n",
      "\n",
      "Foxconn Chairman Young Liu said the facility will be built in phases and will eventually reach 100 megawatts of power, depending on electricity availability. \"We know that power is a very critical resource in Taiwan. I don't want to use the word 'shortage'. So it will take a few steps to reach 100 megawatts. We'll start with 20 megawattsâ€¦ then add another 40,\" he said. Initial development is planned in the city of Kaohsiung, with additional locations under consideration.\n",
      "\n",
      "The AI computing centre is part of Taiwan's broader aim to strengthen its AI capabilities and support domestic innovation. Government officials have indicated that the facility will be central to efforts in AI education, healthcare, urban planning, and industry-led research.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, speaking at the event, described the project as an asset for Taiwan's wider tech community. \"We're going to build an AI factory right for you (Foxconn) to use, for me to use, and for Taiwan's entire ecosystem to use,\" he said, noting that Nvidia currently has around 350 partners in the country.\n"

      "The artificial intelligence (AI) revolution has ignited a race among hardware suppliers, and two of the most prominent names riding this wave are NVIDIA Corporation NVDA and Super Micro Computer, Inc. SMCI. NVIDIA dominates the AI graphics processing unit (GPU) market, while Super Micro rides the same wave by designing ultra-efficient, NVIDIA’s chip-optimized servers for hyperscalers and enterprises.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both stocks have delivered exceptional returns, but which is the better bet now? Let’s break down their fundamentals, valuation, growth outlook and looming risks to find out which one is a better investment option today.\n",
      "\n",
      "NVDA: The AI Chip Giant With Dominance\n",
      "\n",
      "NVIDIA is an undisputed leader in AI chips, data centers, gaming and autonomous vehicles. Its products are at the center of the ongoing AI revolution, driving demand from hyperscalers, enterprises and cutting-edge startups alike. The data center end-market continues to be a powerhouse for NVIDIA. Revenues from this end-market surged 93% year over year to $35.58 billion in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025.\n",
      "\n",
      "NVIDIA’s latest earnings call underscored the company’s continued AI dominance. CEO Jensen Huang highlighted the increasing demand for next-generation AI models that require unprecedented computational power. The company’s Blackwell architecture, capable of delivering up to 25 times the token throughput of its predecessor, is expected to drive the next wave of AI adoption.\n",
      "\n",
      "Further bolstering its leadership, NVIDIA is set to launch its Blackwell Ultra and Vera Rubin platforms, which could solidify its position as the go-to AI infrastructure provider. With governments, corporations and cloud providers ramping up AI investments, NVIDIA remains the key beneficiary of this seismic shift in computing.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the recent restrictions imposed by the Trump administration on exporting H20 chips to China are likely to hurt NVIDIA’s overall financial growth in the near term. The company’s CEO, Jensen Huang, recently stated that export restrictions on H20 chips have cost the company $15 billion in sales and expects approximately $5.5 billion in charges due to the ban in the first quarter of fiscal 2026.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the headwinds, NVIDIA is anticipated to remain on a high-growth trajectory. The company expects revenues of $43 billion (+/-2%) in the first quarter of fiscal 2026, indicating a year-over-year growth of more than 65%.\n",
      "\n",
      "SMCI: A High-Risk, High-Reward AI Infrastructure Play\n",
      "\n",
      "Super Micro Computer’s growth is driven by the need for AI workloads. As a growing number of data centers are proliferating and existing ones are expanding their capacity, the need for SMCI’s high-performance and energy-efficient servers is rising.\n",
      "\n",
      "Super Micro Computer’s liquid-cooled and modular servers are a hit among cloud service providers, government customers and enterprises as these servers possess the capacity to handle AI at scale. SMCI has further strengthened its AI expertise by collaborating with NVIDIA and integrating its Blackwell GPUs for high compute power.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the massive potential of Super Micro Computer’s server offerings, the company is facing some near-term challenges, including delayed purchasing decisions from customers as they are evaluating the adoption of next-generation AI platforms. SMCI is also facing margin contraction due to the growing price competition and price adjustments as companies are second-guessing their shift from older to newer platforms like Blackwell.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the last reported results for the third quarter of fiscal 2025, Super Micro Computer also incurred a one-time inventory write-down on older-generation GPUs and related components, further affecting its margins. Based on all the above factors, SMCI revised the revenue guidance for fiscal 2025 from the $23.5-$25.0 billion range to a range of $21.8 billion-$22.6 billion.\n",

      "The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Super Micro Computer’s fiscal 2025 EPS indicates a year-over-year decline of 6%, while that for fiscal 2026 signifies growth of 36%. The earnings estimate revision trend for the two fiscals has remained highly volatile over the last 60 days.\n",

      "\n",
      "The consensus mark for NVIDIA’s fiscal 2026 and fiscal 2027 EPS indicates year-over-year growth of 43% and 27%, respectively. Also, the earnings estimate revision trend for the stock has remained more stable compared with a highly volatile trend for SMCI. This stability is a testament to NVDA’s predictable performance in a volatile sector.\n",

      "Both companies have seen share price fluctuations over the past year amid geopolitical tensions and macroeconomic uncertainty. While NVDA shares have soared 42.8% over the past year, SMCI dropped 50.6%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Valuation-wise, both NVIDIA and Super Micro Computer are trading at earnings multiples below their respective industry averages. However, NVDA’s current price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 29.25X is significantly lower than the one-year median of 37.28X. On the other hand, SMCI’s P/E multiple of 16.41X is slightly higher than the one-year median of 16.10X.\n",

      "Conclusion: NVIDIA is the Better AI Hardware Bet Right Now\n",
      "\n",
      "While both NVIDIA and Super Micro Computer are important players in the AI revolution, NVIDIA clearly stands out as the stronger investment today.\n",
      "\n",
      "NVIDIA’s dominant market position, product innovation and earnings consistency make it the AI infrastructure stock of choice. Despite geopolitical challenges, the company is still expected to deliver blockbuster growth in fiscal 2026 and beyond, driven by its next-generation Blackwell architecture and robust customer demand.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, Super Micro Computer is more of a high-risk, high-reward satellite play. It remains a compelling company with niche strengths, but its exposure to product cycles, customer hesitation and margin pressure makes its near-term outlook more uncertain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, NVDA carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at present, making the stock a stronger pick compared with SMCI, which has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).\n",

      "Nvidia stock has recovered recently but is down today.\n",
      "\n",
      "Quick overview\n",
      "\n",
      "Nvidia's stock dropped 1.96% following a lackluster keynote at Computex 2025, failing to deliver any surprising announcements.\n",
      "\n",
      "The company announced plans to target the AI inference market with RTX Pro servers and introduced NVlink Fusion for custom AI infrastructure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the recent stock dip, Nvidia has shown resilience and long-term potential, with expectations of growth as the AI market expands.\n",
      "\n",
      "Investors are advised to consider buying during dips for short-term profits, as Nvidia is likely to recover lost ground soon.\n",
      "\n",
      "After Nvidia (NVDA) presented its keynote at Computex 2025, the company’s stock dropped 1.96%. What should have been a great success for the leading AI tech company turned out to be a miss.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nvidia failed to impress with anything surprising at the Computex conference. The AI chip manufacturer announced that it would be aiming to reach the AI inference market with RTX Pro servers. They also announced that they would be creating NVlink Fusion, which expands the company’s reach beyond Nvidia CPUs.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Fusion is a silicon that would allow for partially custom built AI infrastructure. That expands the company’s product capabilities and lets customers do more with their Nvidia products.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nvidia Stock- Buy, Sell or Wait?\n",
      "\n",
      "Over the last 24 hours, Nvidia’s stock has fallen nearly 2%. On the other hand, in the last five days of trading, the stock has remained active but stable, fluctuating between $132 and $134. The three month view is more telling. In that period, the stock was high around $126 at the start of the period, dropped to a low of $94, and then climbed back up to its present $134 price.\n",
      "\n",
      "What we are seeing is that Nvidia is resilient. This is a stock that has performed well for a few years now and will likely continue to do so. If you have NVDA stock, it does not make sense to sell it right now, since it could easily go much higher, unless you bought it when it was very low.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nvidia stock has tremendous long-term potential, and as long as the AI market is doing well, Nvidia is likely to do well. The company has proven that they can weather storms for monopoly allegations, fierce competition, and even severe tariffs, and they can eventually come out on top. We expect this stock to do very well during the 90-day pause on tariffs, climbing much higher than its current price.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even though the Computex conference did not do much for Nvidia’s stock price, the rapidly growing AI market should help keep it moving along. For those wanting short-term profits, we suggest buying during the next dip, because Nvidia is sure to gain back lost ground shortly afterwards.\n",

    "Interstellar is a 2014 epic science fiction film directed by Christopher Nolan, who co-wrote the screenplay with his brother Jonathan. It features an ensemble cast led by Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Bill Irwin, Ellen Burstyn, and Michael Caine. Set in a dystopian future where Earth is suffering from catastrophic blight and famine, the film follows a group of astronauts who travel through a wormhole near Saturn in search of a new home for mankind.\n",
    "\n",
    "The screenplay had its origins in a script Jonathan developed in 2007 and was originally set to be directed by Steven Spielberg. Theoretical physicist Kip Thorne was an executive producer and scientific consultant on the film, and wrote the tie-in book The Science of Interstellar. It was Lynda Obst's final film as producer before her death. Cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema shot it on 35 mm film in the Panavision anamorphic format and IMAX 70 mm. Filming began in late 2013 and took place in Alberta, Klaustur, and Los Angeles. Interstellar uses extensive practical and miniature effects, and the company DNEG created additional digital effects.\n",

    "Interstellar premiered at the TCL Chinese Theatre on October 26, 2014, and was released in theaters in the United States on November 5, and in the United Kingdom on November 7. In the United States, it was first released on film stock, expanding to venues using digital projectors. The film received generally positive reviews from critics and was a commercial success, grossing $681 million worldwide during its initial theatrical run, and $758.6 million worldwide with subsequent releases, making it the tenth-highest-grossing film of 2014. In addition to being named by the American Film Institute one of the top-ten films of 2014, Intestellar received various accolades, including five Academy Awards nominations at the 87th Academy Awards, and won Best Visual Effects.\n",
