      "\n",
      "The world’s most valuable chipmaker reports Wednesday after market close — the last of the Big Tech cohort to do so. Results from Microsoft Corp., Meta Platforms Inc. and others showed that outlooks remain mostly intact despite uncertainty caused by President Donald Trump’s shifting tariff plans.\n",

      "The reports, along with cooling trade tensions, have helped fuel a rebound in technology stocks that were at the heart of last month’s S&P 500 rout.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Tech results have generally been positive, and in some cases, exceptional,” said Tim Ghriskey, senior portfolio strategist at Ingalls & Snyder. “I think continued strength in Nvidia will support the overall tech trend.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Nvidia shares have soared as its biggest customers pledge to keep spending heavily on equipment for artificial intelligence computing and as new buyers emerge from governments in the Middle East. The stock remains down 9% from its January peak.\n",

      "The focus in the firm’s first-quarter earnings report will be the supply of computer systems based on its new Blackwell chips, which faced manufacturing hiccups that hampered sales in the fourth quarter amid heavy demand. The Santa Clara, California-based company is projected to deliver around $19 billion in net income on revenue of $43 billion in the first quarter, up 31% and 66%, respectively, from the same period a year ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another thing investors will be watching closely is profit margins. In February, Nvidia said higher costs associated with the ramp up of Blackwell production would weigh on gross margins in the first quarter. Gross margins should return to the “mid-70s” by the end of the year from a projection of roughly 71% in the first quarter, Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress said at the time.\n",

      "“We did see a slowdown in margins last quarter and if we see them shrink again, that could bring the stock down,” said Andrew Rocco, a stock strategist at Zacks Investment Research. “I don’t think we’ll see a huge surprise with this report one way or the other but there is a risk with the outlook.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The earnings report has the potential to be complicated owing to US export restrictions of advanced semiconductors to China aimed at slowing the country’s technological progress. Last month, Nvidia wrote off about $5.5 billion in inventory of chips designed explicitly to comply with previous US curbs. Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang has criticized the US policies, which he said will cede a market that could be worth $50 billion in 2026 to Chinese rivals.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wall Street estimates appear to vary widely on the impact of the restrictions, creating the potential for a “messy” quarter, Morgan Stanley analysts led by Joseph Moore wrote in a research note published Tuesday.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nvidia and other technology giants were among the biggest decliners in last month’s rout that sent the S&P 500 to the brink of a bear market. Many of the stocks have recouped much of the losses after Trump temporarily paused the stiffest levies and earnings showed demand remains intact. The Nasdaq 100 Index is outperforming the S&P 500 since the reporting cycle kicked off in mid-April.\n",
      "\n",
      "This earnings season has shown that the biggest buyers of AI computing gear plan to keep plowing money into capital spending, a boon for Nvidia and other makers of computing hardware. Microsoft and Alphabet pledged to spend even more next year, while Meta raised its forecast for capital expenditures in 2025.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is remarkable how much we’ve almost come full circle in a few weeks,” said Rob Almeida, global investment strategist at MFS Investment Management. “The fact that hyperscalers still think they can’t afford to not invest is a pretty strong signal for their intentions over the next four quarters.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the rebound in Nvidia shares, the stock’s valuation relative to anticipated earnings remains at a discount. Nvidia is priced at 29 times profits projected over the next 12 months, compared with a five-year average of 40, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The Nasdaq 100 trades around 26 times projected profits.\n",
      "\n",
      "For Krishna Chintalapalli, a portfolio manager at Parnassus Investments, the attraction to Nvidia as the biggest beneficiary of AI spending remains strong.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I haven’t seen anything in the past three months that would suggest the story has dramatically changed,” Chintalapalli said. “While China is a factor, the Middle East deals suggest broad-based demand for Nvidia chips beyond the US and China.”\n",

Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \\n\\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \\n\\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \\n\\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \\n\\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \\n\\nSix days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \\n\\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \\n\\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \\n\\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \\n\\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.\\nSource: 0-pl\\nContent: And we won’t stop. \\n\\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \\n\\nLet’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \\n\\nLet’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \\n\\nWe can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \\n\\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \\n\\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \\n\\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \\n\\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \\n\\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \\n\\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.\\nSource: 24-pl\\nContent: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \\n\\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \\n\\nAnd I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \\n\\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \\n\\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \\n\\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming. \\n\\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.\\nSource: 5-pl\\nContent: More support for patients and families. \\n\\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \\n\\nIt’s based on DARPA—the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \\n\\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose—to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and more. \\n\\nA unity agenda for the nation. \\n\\nWe can do this. \\n\\nMy fellow Americans—tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space—the citadel of our democracy. \\n\\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \\n\\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \\n\\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \\n\\nNow is the hour. \\n\\nOur moment of responsibility. \\n\\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \\n\\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed.

Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \\n\\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \\n\\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \\n\\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \\n\\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \\n\\nSix days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \\n\\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \\n\\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \\n\\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \\n\\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.\\nSource: 0-pl\\nContent: And we won’t stop. \\n\\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \\n\\nLet’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \\n\\nLet’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \\n\\nWe can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \\n\\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \\n\\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \\n\\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \\n\\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \\n\\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \\n\\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.\\nSource: 24-pl\\nContent: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \\n\\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \\n\\nAnd I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \\n\\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \\n\\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \\n\\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming. \\n\\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.\\nSource: 5-pl\\nContent: More support for patients and families. \\n\\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \\n\\nIt’s based on DARPA—the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \\n\\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose—to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and more. \\n\\nA unity agenda for the nation. \\n\\nWe can do this. \\n\\nMy fellow Americans—tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space—the citadel of our democracy. \\n\\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \\n\\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \\n\\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \\n\\nNow is the hour. \\n\\nOur moment of responsibility. \\n\\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \\n\\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. \\n\\nWell I know this nation.\\nSource: 34-pl\\n=========\\nFINAL ANSWER: The president did not mention Michael Jackson.\\nSOURCES:\\n\\nQUESTION: Which new models were launched by anthropic recently?\\n=========\\nContent: It’s been a packed month for Anthropic.
